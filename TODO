- Not all lines that begin with % are errors, some are warnings. Users should have the option to skip calling error() for these.

- Have the program send a newline if it connects but doesn't get any data. This can "wake the router up".

- print() reported not to log. Investigate.

- More TACACS support

- test.pl should use full login() semantics
